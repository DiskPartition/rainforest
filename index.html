          <p>Leon Henderson: Hey listeners, it's me, Leon Henderson, welcome back to Golden State Stories, here in San Francisco! Before we start, remember that you can listen ad free on Rainforest Audio. Today we have stories from a man who has some quite deep experience with the gold rush of 1849. </p>
          <p>Ji Lang: Hi, I’m Ji Lang. I grew up in a poor family in China and worked from the age of 9 as a grain farmer with my father, who became sick and passed away when I was 15. I was working one day, like I did every day, the sun beating down on my skin, the crops rustling around my feet, when I saw someone dashing by, excitedly explaining that a man had returned from America and was planning a feast for all to attend. When I walked into the lavished home that night, I instantly smelled the delightful aroma of the chicken and pig on the table, and heard the happy chattering of the members of my village. The man then explained to me that he had obtained his great wealth from the country of American wizards. Everyone there was enthralled, and I instantly decided to make that journey.  He excitedly explained that the nation’s leader, President Polk, had just confirmed the presence of vast quantities of gold, free riches for all to go there.</p>
          <p>Leon Henderson: How was the journey across the Pacific Ocean?</p>
          <p>Ji Lang: I traveled to Hong Kong and boarded a grimy, cramped steam ship with many others, and I could see on the shining sea hundreds of other boats. Later I would learn that over 20,000 left for those prosperous dreams. The journey was long, but most of us would end up in California weeks later. Once we first saw land, everyone went on to the deck and began cheering.</p>
          <p>Leon Henderson: What were you feeling once you arrived?</p>
          <p>Ji Lang: Once we docked, there was a stampede of passengers, squeezing off shoulder-to-shoulder. When I got off the ship, I saw dozens of other boats bringing thousands of miners into San Francisco. Every claim of land, as far as I could see, was filled with hundreds of quickly built shops and establishments looking to make a profit off of the rush. Thousands of young men bustled through the streets, carrying their equipment. I was amazed by just how developed and full this land was, how fast-paced and exciting. I could smell the scents of food, tools, and men, and taste the brisk air. Thousands were screaming out of excitement or joy, and at the time I did not know why, for I was told that it was a place of guaranteed riches.</p>
          <p>Leon Henderson: What was your experience with mining like?</p>
          <p>Ji Lang: I quickly ended up just outside of Coloma. I saw the landscape, which reminded me a little of my home, and decided that that was the place I’d find gold. I worked 12 hours every day, on cloudy dull days and on sunny hellish days, but found no success with gold mining. I learned in time that there was more luck than skill involved in mining, although each riverbank was filled with hundreds of people. The only thing I could hear was the sounds of water  rushing, the shaking of the batea pans and the yelling of miners arguing over claims. </p>
          <p>Leon Henderson: At what point did you stop mining?</p>
          <p>Ji Lang: Now after 7 months or so I had begun to grow very tired of this useless work, work that wasn’t yielding me any amount of money, but it was mistreatment that caused me to quit. You see, as the supply of gold diminished, the American miners didn’t take kindly to my presence as they believed I was an “intruder” and “stealing their gold.” I even paid the foreigners tax. I was hunched over the river one morning and saw a big man approaching. Abruptly, he grabbed my arms and cut my hair with his knife before harshly whispering, telling me to leave and walking away. It was then that I decided I was leaving. Our queues are a custom that lives with us our whole lives. I got my belongings and stormed out.  Away from the river, I considered an idea which I hadn’t considered since I had arrived, which was opening a business. I traveled to Sacramento and noticed a lack of Chinese food that I used to enjoy, so I decided to use what I had left to start a restaurant.</p>
          <p>Leon Henderson: I know that many Chinese immigrants chose to start businesses. Did it go well for you?</p>
          <p>Ji Lang: I knew that it could work, but I didn’t see just how well it would work. The day after I opened, the restaurant was full with hungry miners. I was in the kitchen when I heard a customer yelling for my attention. I expected him to be mad about my race’s presence, but instead he thanked me and told me that our culture and food was some of the best around. I instantly became wealthy, and once the gold rush had ended, I continued serving food for the settlers from the Transcontinental Railroad, which leads us up to today. I still work at that restaurant, and have achieved my dreams of wealth. Despite the racism that I’ve experienced, many Californians have been more generous to me than others in China. </p>
          <p>Leon Henderson: Is there anything else you’d like to add?</p>
          <p>Ji Lang: I suppose, if anything, I would just want people to remember to be kind to others, and to also remember that the American dream is a concept that everyone can dedicate themselves to and achieve.</p>
          <p>Leon Henderson: Over 250,000 miners came during the gold rush, and many remain today. Around 10% of them are Chinese, and they define our state. Now iconic cities like San Francisco would increase in population by multiples of ten over the next 10 years. Their contributions to our nation are immense and cannot be ignored. We’d be fools to reject their rich cultures.</p>
